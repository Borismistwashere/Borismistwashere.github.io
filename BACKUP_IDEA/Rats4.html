			<p><h1>The figure finally turns to face you, its face was nearly impossible to make out...</h1></p><br>

			<p><h2>The only thing visible were its glowing yellow eyes...</h2></p>

			<p><h3>"A rubber room..." The figure said, now staring directly at you.</h3></p>
			<p><h4>You hear the scurrying once again, this time it was much closer than before...</h4></p>
			<p><h5>It sounds as if it was several small animals running all over, you feel the hair on your body start to lift up as a chill runs through your system...</h5></p>

				<p><a href= "Rats5.html">"Um..."</a></p>
				<p><a href= "Rats5.html">"Oh h-hello..."</a></p>
				<p><a href= "Rats5.html">"What about a rubber room?..."</a></p>
				<p><a href= "Rats5.html">Continue listening quietly, unphased by the figure's strange eyes</a></p>
