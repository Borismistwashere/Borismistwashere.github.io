			<p><h1>"And rats..." The creature says as several squeaks could be heard from it's coat...</h1></p><br>

			<p><h2>Before you can react, the strange creature throws open its coat, unleashing a mini tsunami of rats!</h2></p>

			<p><h3>As the rats all fall out from the coat, the creature stood proudly upon its stool wearing a bright green and black sweater underneath as it said...</h3></p>
			<p><h4>"Rats make me crazy!" The creature said, eventually running off with the other rats, leaving the trenccoat and fedora behind on the stool...</h4></p>

				<p><a href= "NoMoreRats.html">"AAA- RAT TSUNAMI!!!"</a></p>
